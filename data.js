Cardiologists specialize in understanding the intricacies of the cardiovascular system, including the heart and blood vessels. They employ a variety of diagnostic tools such as echocardiograms, electrocardiograms (ECGs), and stress tests to assess heart health and function. Common conditions treated by cardiologists include coronary artery disease, heart failure, arrhythmias, and congenital heart defects. Treatment approaches may involve lifestyle modifications, medications, cardiac procedures such as angioplasty or stent placement, or surgical interventions like bypass surgery. Cardiology plays a vital role in preventing and managing cardiovascular diseases, which remain a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide.",
